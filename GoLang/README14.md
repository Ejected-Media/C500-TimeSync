Based on our design for the C500 TimeSync project, we can create several other diagrams to visualize different aspects of the system. Here are a few key workflows that would benefit from visual representation:
 * The Student Booking Flow: A step-by-step diagram showing how a student requests a session, sees times in their local timezone, and confirms a booking. This would illustrate the interaction between the Discord Bot, the GoLang Engine's timezone conversion logic, and the Firebase database.
 * The Smart Reminder Flow: A diagram illustrating how the system automatically sends reminders. This would show the Cloud Scheduler triggering the process, the GoLang Engine fetching booking data and live weather context, and the Discord Bot delivering the personalized message to the student.
 * The Emergency Cancellation Flow: A diagram depicting the "Red Button" protocol. This would show the Mentor initiating the cancellation, the GoLang Engine updating the database, and the system automatically drafting and sending a context-aware cancellation message to the student.
